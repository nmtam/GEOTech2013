        <h3>Overview of Geo Hazards in Vietnam</h3>
        <p>At present, geo-hazards occur ever more widely in the world with ever increasing intensity due to global climate change, movements of the Earth crust and environmentally unfriendly economic activities. In Vietnam, geo-hazards also occur increasingly in various areas such as highlands and coastal plains and at any time of the day or night, causing great losses to human livelihood and property.</p>
        <p>In the Northern mountainous region of Vietnam alone, from 1990 to the present, thirty flash flood events have occurred, causing 988 people to be either killed or be missing, 698 people injured; 13.280 houses destroyed and almost 180.000 hectares of agricultural land and crops to be adversely affected. Vietnam experienced the heaviest calamities since the beginning of the 21st century in the year 2005, with a total estimated loss of 5,232 billionVND (equivalent to about 500 million USD).</p>
        <p>Recently, in August 2007, the extremely high rainfall, in some places up to 800-900mm/day, caused floods over vast areas of the central provinces of Vietnam with accompanying mudflows and landslides in many areas from the mountainous to coastal areas of Ha Tinh and Quang Binh provinces. Seventy five 75 people were killed and estimated losses 1,200 billion VND (equivalent to about 120 million USD) resulted. Coastal erosion occurs in many places at the rate of 50m/year over a length of up to 3,000m as in the estuarine area of Bac Lieu. River bank erosion occurs even in large cities, such as Ho Chi Minh City, forcing hundreds of households to be resettled. For the economy of Vietnam, the above losses are very serious.</p>
        <h3>Geo-hazards investigation, monitoring, andprecaution in Vietnam</h3>
        <p>Within the territory of Vietnam about 20 types of geo-hazards have been recorded belonging to 4 genetic groups: endogenic, exogenic, mixed endo-exogenic and anthropogenic, commonly comprising: earthquakes, active faulting, surface faulting, land subsidence, landslides, rock falls, flash floods, mudflows, riverbank and coastal erosion, sedimentation causing changes of shipping channels, and desertification. Recognizing the adverse effects of geo-hazards, the State of Vietnam is now paying much attention to, and provided funding for, the research and investigation of geo-hazards. This includes environmental geology and urban geological surveys at 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 scales in 64 urban areas. Geo-hazards surveys and investigations include mapping at scales of 1:500,000, 1:200,000, 1:100,000 and 1:50,000 in large areas of the Northwest, Eastern North, Mid Central, Central highland and Southern Central regions as well as in the shallow offshore areas (0-30m water depth) of Vietnam. The primary objectives of these activities are to find the causes of the hazards and to and delineate high risk areas and propose prevention and mitigation measures. Vietnam has established national natural resources and environmental monitoring network covering several aspects of measurement and monitoring (hydrology and meteorology, earthquake, groundwater, environment, radioactivity). Every year this monitoring network is supplemented with new monitoring stations and equipment.</p>
        <p>For many years, the Institute of Geophysics (under the Vietnamese Academy of Science and Technology - VAST) has carried out investigations in collaboration with other geological organizations in the country for compiling an earthquake zoning map of Vietnam. This map shows that there are areas with medium to low magnitude earthquakes according to MSK-64 scale, and serves as a scientific basis for anti-seismic design of building structures. </p>
